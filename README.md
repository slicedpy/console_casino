# console_casino
Welcome to the slicedpy casino!

This repository is for console based games of chance; a decent way to practice simple python functions and logic. It's meant to be fun above all--no actual loss can only mean gain, right?

Eventually, all of the mini-games will be one grand package to play at once.



TODO:
blackjack credits need adjustment to not allow player to play or bet with balance of "0"
blackjack symbols: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15102222/how-to-display-special-characters-in-python-with-print

horse races  need more horses (up to 7?); adjustment to not allow play to play or bet with balance of "0"
add stats board (files) to create actualy odds (properties?)
[x]convert to use oop --> needs improvement
allow for different weighted variables (like jocky and weather)
(9 Dec 2016) Get the interaction working properly


IDEAS:
create base for console_roullette (practice of time/sleep)

create console_slotmachine (or better off practice tkinter?)

create console_keno?

create console_bingo (introduce bots/other players)

create console_craps

create console_sportsbook

might make worthwhile to create complete package of mini-games based on one 'credit-wallet'
