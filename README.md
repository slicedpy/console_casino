# console_casino
console based games of chance; a decent way to practice simple python functions

TODO:
blackjack credits need adjustment to not allow player to play or bet with balance of "0"

horse races  need more horses (up to 7?); adjustment to not allow play to play or bet with balance of 0
add stats board (files) to create actualy odds (properties?)
convert to use oop
allow for different weighted variables (like jocky and weather)


IDEAS:
create base for console_roullette (practice of time/sleep)

create console_slotmachine (or better off practice tkinter?)

create console_keno?

create console_bingo (introduce bots/other players)

create console_craps

create console_sportsbook

might make worthwhile to create complete package of mini-games based on one 'credit-wallet'
